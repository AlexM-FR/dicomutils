In rough order of priority:

* Table top shift, tilt & pitch plus eccentric table top - would complete geometric model

* Use BeamMU in lightfield

* Reading parts of the study, e.g. reading CT and creating an RTSTRUCT on the CT, or reading CT & RTSTRUCT and creating RTPLAN, or reading CT, RTSTRUCT and RTPLAN and writing lightfield RTDOSE.

* Electrons modality - would probably mostly be supporting blocks and setting radiation type

* MR support

* PET support

* Wedges

* RT Ion Plans

* RT Images?
